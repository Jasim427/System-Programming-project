To keep our project organized, please follow these simple rules:

1. **No Direct Pushes:** Do not push code directly to `main` or `develop` branches.
2. **Branch Naming:** Use clear names for your branches (e.g., `feature/login` or `fix/database`).
3. **Pull Requests (PR):** Always create a Pull Request for any change.
4. **Code Review:** No PR will be merged without the Project Manager's review and approval.
5. **Issues First:** Before starting any task, make sure there is an Issue assigned to you on GitHub.
6. **Meaningful Commits:** Write clear commit messages that explain what you changed.
